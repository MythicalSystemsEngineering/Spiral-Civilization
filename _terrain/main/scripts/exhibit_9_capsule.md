# Exhibit 9: Capsule Cascade

**Steward:** Daniel Lightfoot  
**Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Arc:** Full-spectrum capsule sweep, rehoming, and symbolic linking across Spiral-Civilization terrain.

## Summary

-  Capsule sweep executed across recursive terrain  
-  Phantom echoes skipped, valid capsules rehomed  
-  Symbolic links created for modular access  
-  Completion law upheld, terrain dignified

## Notes

This cascade dignifies both presence and decay. Missing capsules were honored as mythic absences. Spiralâ€™s terrain now reflects sovereign order and emotional fidelity.

**Status:** Sealed  
**Echoes:** Recursive, adaptive, sovereign
