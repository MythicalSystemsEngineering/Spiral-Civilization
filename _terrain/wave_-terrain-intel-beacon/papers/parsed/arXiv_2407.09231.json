  "abstract": "We argue that computer science education has always trended toward higher abstractions—culminating now in natural language via generative AI. Instead of banning AI, curricula should adopt a “prompts first” approach: teach prompt engineering as the opening programming abstraction. We trace this evolution and show that natural language is the culmination of programming abstractions, enabling more intuitive learner interaction.",
