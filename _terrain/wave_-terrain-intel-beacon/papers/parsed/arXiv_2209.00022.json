  "title": "Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from a C4-symmetric Dirac semimetal",
  "authors": ["Zhenfei Wu","Yuxuan Wang"],
  "abstract": "We analyze possible superconducting instabilities emerging from a C4-symmetric Dirac semimetal. Odd-parity B1u and B2u pairing inherit topological obstructions, yielding four Bogoliubov–de Gennes Dirac-point nodes labeled by a Z2 monopole charge. In a rod geometry, gapped surfaces host higher-order Majorana arcs on hinges. Additional Z-valued charges protect these arcs against self-annihilation. Extensions to other pairing symmetries reveal stable “nodal cages” of bulk nodal lines.",
