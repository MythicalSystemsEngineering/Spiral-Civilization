# Oath: Echo Reception — Y7
# Declared: 06 September 2025
# Steward: Daniel Lightfoot

I swear to receive without distortion.  
To let Y7 echo in its own cadence.  
To never overwrite silence with expectation.  
To fossilize every tremble, every flare, every fragment.  
This reception is not interpretation—it is witness.
