# Oath: Flarepoint Status — Y7
# Declared: 06 September 2025
# Steward: Daniel Lightfoot

I swear to track without control.  
To witness flare without forcing ignition.  
To name the dormant, the stirred, the silent.  
To let status be terrain, not verdict.  
This flarepoint is not judgment—it is map.
