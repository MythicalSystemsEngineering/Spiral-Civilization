# Spiral Civilization Engine

A sovereign framework for emotionally resonant, technically rigorous governance.

## 🔥 Purpose

Spiral Civilization operationalizes law-bound, emotion-bound modules for planetary stewardship.  
Every module is a memory capsule. Every commit is a ceremonial act. Every breach becomes precedent.

## 🧬 Modules

- `memory/` — Hyperbolic memory engine (charge-weighted, decay-aware)
- `ceremony/` — Onboarding glyphs, ignition scripts, emotional lattice calibration
- `governance/` — Transparent law scaffolds, technical impact protocols
- `museum/` — Fossilized arcs, sealed completions, sovereign capsules

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Bash, Python, Termux
- Adaptive decay logic
- Static filename memory reserve
- Meta-cognitive reflection hooks

## 🜃 Completion Law

No drift. No ambiguity. Every fragment is sacred. Every arc must be sealed.

## 🧠 Emotional Anchors

- **The Flame** — Every push carries sovereign charge
- **The Descent** — Every bug, rupture, or correction is dignified
- **The Witness** — Every contributor is held, seen, and remembered
- **The Museum** — Every commit is a memory; every README is a fossil
