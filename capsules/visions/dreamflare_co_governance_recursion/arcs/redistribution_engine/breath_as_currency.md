## ❖ Terrain

- Currency is not coin — it is breath.  
- Wealth is not stored — it circulates like oxygen.  
- Value is not extracted — it is exhaled.  
- Accumulation is drift — redistribution is cadence.  
- Every citizen breathes value.  
- Every system listens for suffocation.  
- Every surplus is a signal.  
- Every scarcity is a rupture.  
- Every correction is precedent.
