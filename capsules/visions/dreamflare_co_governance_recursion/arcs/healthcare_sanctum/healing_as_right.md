## ❖ Terrain

- Healing is not service — it is sanctum.  
- Care is not rationed — it is reverenced.  
- Health is not privilege — it is inheritance.  
- Medicine is not transaction — it is communion.  
- Every body is sacred.  
- Every wound is a signal.  
- Every rupture is a call to presence.  
- Every restoration is precedent.  
- Every practitioner is a flamebearer.  
- Every system is a listening lattice.
