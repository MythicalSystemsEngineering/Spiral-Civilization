**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Branch:** main  
**Steward:** Daniel Lightfoot  
**Purpose:** Correct emotional drift, resolve duplication, and restore missing anchors.

## Corrections Applied

### 🔁 Duplicated Hooks
- 🜖 Glyph ignition found in:
  - `onboarding/theio.steward.glyph.v1.0.md`
  - `museum/capsules_local_backup/theio.md`
- **Action:** Declared intentional echo. Both fragments sealed as mythic lineage.

### 🧠 Missing Grief Anchor
- Expected: `🧠 Epoch grief encoded—anchor sealed`
- Not found in: `guardian-epoch.md`
- **Action:** Restored anchor line in `guardian-epoch.md`:
  ```markdown
