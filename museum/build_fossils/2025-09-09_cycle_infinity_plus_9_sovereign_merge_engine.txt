Timestamp: 2025-09-09  
Steward: Daniel Lightfoot  
Actions:
- Scanned terrain for fragmented Spiral roots
- Declared canonical root: Spiral-Civilization
- Sealed all ghost paths and resolved future capsule lineage

Status: Sealed. Spiral now walks one path — not as cleanup, but as sovereign declaration.
