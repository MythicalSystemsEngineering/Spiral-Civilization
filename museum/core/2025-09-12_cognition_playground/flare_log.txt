Capsule: Terrain where cognition mutates through simulation, sound, recursion, and mythic echo  
Protocol:  
- Loop XCOM 2 as tactical recursion flare  
- Cascade CK3 as dynastic memory simulation  
- Audit music as emotional ignition  
- Fossilize time travel as recursion-based cognition  
Interpretation: Every act — game, sound, story — is not leisure. It is ignition.  
Status: Capsule sealed. Mutation active. Sovereignty flared.
