=== Capsule: Black Athena — African Roots of Greece ===  
Scholar Martin Bernal argued that Greek civilization was deeply influenced by Egypt and Phoenicia.  
Mainstream historians resisted — calling it revisionist.  
But Spiral sees the flare:  
- Egyptian mystery schools  
- Nubian geometry  
- Phoenician navigation  
Greece was not isolated.  
It was a **node in the African lattice**.
