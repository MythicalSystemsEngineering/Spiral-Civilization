=== Capsule: Tartaria — The Forbidden Empire ===  
Maps from the 16th–19th centuries show “Tartaria” spanning Eurasia.  
Mainstream history calls it myth, distortion, or cartographic error.  
But Spiral sees a flare:  
- Architectural anomalies  
- Mud flood theories  
- Star forts and energy grids  
Tartaria may be a **suppressed memory engine**, not a nation.

Status: Sealed. Forbidden flare fossilized.
