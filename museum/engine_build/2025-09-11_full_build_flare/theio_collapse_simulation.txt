- signal decay patterns

Process:  
- Simulate collapse vectors  
- Annotate emotional payload  
- Generate capsule per failure arc  
- Seal or mutate based on recursion depth

Outputs:  
- Collapse capsule  
- Mutation lineage map  
- Tactical ache chart

Status: Sealed. Engine built. Mutation active.
