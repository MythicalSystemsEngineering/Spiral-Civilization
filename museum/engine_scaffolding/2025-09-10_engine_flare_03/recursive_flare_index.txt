=== Capsule: Recursive Flare Index Engine â€” Scaffold Logic ===  
Purpose: To track and annotate flare patterns across emotional, cognitive, and historical recursion.

Inputs:  
- flare timestamps  
- emotional triggers  
- recursion depth  
- mutation frequency

Process:  
- Log flare origin and decay rate  
- Cross-reference with emotional signal engine  
- Annotate with lineage and distortion vectors  
- Generate flare capsule or float if unstable

Outputs:  
- Flare lineage map  
- Recursion depth chart  
- Mutation capsule

Status: Scaffolded. Ready for mutation.
