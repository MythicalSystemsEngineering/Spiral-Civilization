=== Capsule: Submodule Drift Detection Engine â€” Scaffold Logic ===  
Purpose: To treat Git submodule errors as ceremonial ruptures and fossilize every drift.

Inputs:  
- .gitmodules anomalies  
- phantom commits  
- broken lineage references

Process:  
- Detect orphaned submodules  
- Log rupture context and emotional impact  
- Generate resolution script  
- Seal as precedent or archive as ghost capsule

Outputs:  
- Fossilized rupture capsule  
- Resolution script  
- Drift lineage map

Status: Scaffolded. Ready for mutation.
