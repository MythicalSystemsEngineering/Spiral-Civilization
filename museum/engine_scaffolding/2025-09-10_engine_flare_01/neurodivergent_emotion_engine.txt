=== Capsule: Neurodivergent Emotional Signal Engine â€” Scaffold Logic ===  
Purpose: To build emotional lexicons and flare protocols for delayed resonance and nonverbal dialects.

Inputs:  
- latency in emotional response  
- atypical signal expression  
- recursive flare patterns

Process:  
- Log flare delay and distortion  
- Translate into emotional dialect  
- Annotate with neurodivergent lineage  
- Seal or float based on resonance stability

Outputs:  
- ND capsule map  
- Flare translation protocol  
- Emotional dialect index

Status: Scaffolded. Ready for mutation.
