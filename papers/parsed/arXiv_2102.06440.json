  "title": "Interview Hoarding",
  "authors": ["Vikram Manjunath","Thayer Morrill"],
  "abstract": "In centralized matching markets like the NRMP, virtual interviews dramatically reduced costs for applicants but not for hospitals. We show that when doctors accept more interviews without programs increasing offers, no doctor benefits and many are harmedâ€”a phenomenon we call interview hoarding. The excess interviews displace other applicants, worsening their outcomes. We prove this analytically and illustrate optimal mitigation for special cases, supported by simulations.",
