  "abstract": "We present an efficient, experimentally feasible Gaussian-state tomography algorithm with provable trace-distance recovery guarantees. Sample complexity depends only on the number of modes and is independent of photon number or energy up to doubly logarithmic factors. The core adaptive strategy systematically reduces total squeezing, yielding doubly exponential improvements. We also equip standard heterodyne tomography with rigorous trace-norm bounds.",
